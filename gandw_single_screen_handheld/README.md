# Power

## TP4056

A TP4056 module is used to charge the battery. These modules are designed for charging 18650 batteries at 1A.

For charing 10440 batteries, resistor R3 should be replaced with a 4.7kÎ© resistor. This will charge the battery at approximately 250mA.

A mosfet (AO3401A) is used to disconnect the load from the battery while it is charging. This can be skipped if you remember to always turn off the device when it is charging.

The TP4056 can only be mounted via the holes in the USB voltage pads. When you insert a screw into the pads it might break the connection between the top and bottom pads. Check after connecting and if the connection is broken you might need to use a jumper wire to fix the issue.

## Battery Level Indicator

The battery voltage is sent to GPIO 16 for a battery level indicator. The ESP32-S3 ADC can measure voltages up to 3.1V so a voltage divider is used to drop the voltage to a suitable level.

With a few changes, the AO3401A mosfet can be setup to power the load from USB power while the battery is changing, however if you choose to do this you will also need to alter the voltage divider values to make sure the voltage at GPIO 16 does not exceed 3.1V.

## Jumper

A jumper has been placed between the ESP32 5v pin and the switch. This jumper should be open when connecting the ESP32 to USB for debugging. Failure to open the jumper will result in voltage from ESP32 making its way to the batteries if the switch is also turned on. You could skip the jumper installation, and always make sure the switch is off when debugging, but you will need the jumper installed and open if you want to debug the battery level indicator code.

View 3D files: [Single Screen Handheld 3D Files](../assets/3d_files/gandw_single_screen_handheld/)

## Button Circuit Boards

The buttons need to be mounted on 2.54mm perfboard. 

The alarm and ACL buttons need to be mounted slightly high on the board. Use the spacer (alarm_acl_button_spacer.stl) to mount them at the correct height.

The diagrams below show how to mount the buttons:
